# 🔐 Splunk SIEM Project – Security Log Analysis & Dashboards

## 📌 Overview
This project showcases my hands-on experience with **Splunk for Security Information and Event Management (SIEM)**.  
I ingested multiple datasets (SSH, HTTP, and Linux authentication logs) into Splunk, wrote SPL queries for analysis, and built dashboards to detect suspicious activity such as brute force attempts, unauthorized access, and abnormal web traffic.

## ⚙️ Skills Demonstrated
- Log ingestion & parsing in Splunk  
- Writing SPL (Search Processing Language) queries  
- Building dashboards for visualization  
- Detecting brute force & unauthorized access attempts  
- Analyzing HTTP traffic for suspicious behavior  

---

## 📊 Key Components

### 🔹 SSH Log Analysis
- Detected failed and successful SSH login attempts  
- Identified brute force activity from suspicious IPs  
- Counted total SSH connections  

### 🔹 Splunk Dashboard Creation
- Panels for:
  - Top Source & Destination IPs  
  - Failed vs Successful Logins  
  - Source-to-Destination IP mapping  

### 🔹 Unauthorized Access Investigation
- Investigated Linux authentication logs  
- Queried login attempts by user/IP  
- Detected abnormal access patterns  

### 🔹 HTTP Log Analysis
- Found top endpoints generating traffic  
- Counted server errors (5xx)  
- Detected scripted attack tools via User-Agent  
- Identified large file transfers (over 500KB)

## ✅ Conclusion
This project demonstrates my ability to use **Splunk in a SOC (Security Operations Center) environment**—covering the full workflow from **log ingestion → query building → visualization → incident detection**.  
It highlights my practical SIEM skills in real-world security monitoring and investigation.
